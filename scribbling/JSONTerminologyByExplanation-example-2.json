      2. Maximum Likelihood: It's a method to estimate the parameters of a model that maximizes the likelihood function.
      3. Bayesian Inference: It's a statistical method that updates the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence/ data becomes available.
      4. Feed-forward: It's a type of neural network architecture where information moves in one direction-- from the input layer, through hidden layers, to the output layer.
      5. Convolutional: It's a type of neural network designed for image processing, where the neurons in the layers are connected in such a way that they resemble the visual cortex.
      6. Transformer Neural Networks: These are types of models used in natural language processing which utilize self-attention mechanisms and can handle long-range dependencies in data.
      7. Error Back Propagation: It's a method used in neural networks to adjust the weights by calculating the gradient of the loss function."""
